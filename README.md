## Bering10KPostprocessing

This repository holds an informal collection of Matlab functions that I use when postprocessing the output from a variety of Bering10K ROMS simulations.

Disclaimers: This collection is under active development and is intended for a very specific use case. It also depends on a number of external Matlab toolboxes (both my own and other publicly-available ones) that I have not included in this repository.
